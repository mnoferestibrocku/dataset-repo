Welcome to our artifact GitHub repository!

# Kernel-level events
We present an artifact that comprises kernel-level events collected through the utilization of well-known open-source tools, Elasticsearch and Kibana, renowned for their robust log management and analysis capabilities.

# Two workloads
We defined reports thoughtfully organized into two distinct types of workloads: light and heavy. These workloads are executed at varying periods to provide you with a comprehensive range of scenarios. 

# Four Types of Noise
Our commitment to realism extends further as we introduce four types of simulated noiseâ€”CPU, I/O, Network, and Memory. 
These simulated noises replicate real-world disruptions and challenges, enhancing the authenticity of the artifact and offering a more accurate representation of performance and analysis accuracy challenges.

We invite you to explore, utilize, and contribute to this invaluable resource as we collectively work towards advancing performance engineering research and applications.
