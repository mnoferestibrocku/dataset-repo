# Phase Detection Application of the Proposed Artifact

Application phases correspond to specific intervals during software execution characterized by consistent behaviors and resource requirements. Recognizing these phases enhances understanding of an application's performance traits and supports optimization. Tracing is essential for analyzing, debugging, and monitoring running processes. The sequence of events generated during execution can reveal software phases. 

Event sequences can be segmented into windows, where each window covers specific amount of time. For each window, multiple features can be generated to show the perspective of the software's execution including the Software Behaviour and Resource Utilization features. Various machine learning algorithms offer the capability to perform tasks like clustering, classification, or phase prediction by leveraging features extracted from the artifact. For instance, features such as the count of system calls within specific time intervals or the duration of these calls can be harnessed. These features, which are influenced by factors like system load and noise, empower machine learning algorithms to discern patterns and forecast distinct phases of system behavior.
