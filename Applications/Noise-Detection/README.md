Performance analysis serves a dual purpose: it not only fine-tunes the utilization of system resources but also plays a crucial role in enhancing system reliability. The emergence of non-deterministic and undesired variations, referred to as performance noise, significantly impacts the anticipated or desired reliability of a system~(\cite{de2022operating,rameshan2014stay}). This noise can lead to decreased throughput, heightened latency, inefficient resource utilization, and an overall decline in system performance
